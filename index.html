                        The player is lead to come across many new and interesting things.
                        He will first create a relationship with those.
                        But, in the end, he’ll have to let go of every one of them and focus on building up his own strength.

                    In this first level, the player is introduced to the game’s mechanics.
                    The games encourages him to play with those, in what seems to be a playground environment.

                <p>
                    Although, the player won't progress until he understands there is a greater goal to strive for,
                    and use the mechanics he learned to achieve it.

                    During this step, the player is introduced with a new mechanic he can use to destroy the environment.
                    Its input is fun to execute, and its consequences are enjoyable to watch.

                    That is until he realises that those firework like explosion he creates aren't doing any good.

                    The player is led into a torrent that is easy to sweep along.
                    The more the player sinks down the stream, the more gloomy the atmosphere becomes.

                    The player have to turn against the flow of water and make use of everything he learned to face it and progress through the most difficult part of the game.

                    He is presented to the ghost figure of the main character’s lost dear one.
                    As the player try to catch up the ghost, the gap increases.
                    No matter how energy he puts in, how well he performs, in the end, he’ll never be able to catch up.

                <p>
                    He finally have to chose to go a separate path, maybe looking over his shoulder to see the ghost waving him goodbye.
